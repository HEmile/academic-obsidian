# A Template for Academic Obsidian Use
I've been using Obsidian for 5 years now (early adopter!) for academic research, and have tweaked and simplified my setup to the core ingredients needed. This demo vault provides all plugins and functionality I rely on, on a daily basis; little more is needed. It's 95% core Obsidian!

The philosophy behind my approach comes from the idea of [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph). Notes are quite structured and atomic to prevent duplication and to optimize for retrieval. However, I also did my best to minimize the overhead for adding this structure. 

If you want to learn about this approach, please read the accompanying blog post at (TODO).
