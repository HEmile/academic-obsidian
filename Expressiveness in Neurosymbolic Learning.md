We showed in [[On the independence assumption in neurosymbolic learning]] that the common assumption in Neurosymbolic learning that concepts are [[independence|independent]] from each other given the input, can really impact [[uncertainty quantification]]. 

How do we overcome this? One idea is using [[discrete diffusion models|masked diffusion]], a very expressive kind of [[deep generative models]]. This can result in [[Neurosymbolic Diffusion Models]].
